Store and retrieve EDN data in AWS SSM Paramstore

*Why SSM Parameter Store ?*
AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store provides secure, hierarchical
storage for configuration data. It is a great alternative to Consul or
Vault for storing service configuration. Think of it as a managed
Config store in the AWS cloud.

*ednism* provides simple APIs (get, put, history and delete) to store
and retrieve EDN data in paramstore

*ednism* also caches =get= and invalidates the cache on =put=

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[ednism.core :as e])
(e/init! {:provider :profile
          :profile (System/getenv "AWS_PROFILE")
          :region  "us-east-1"})

(e/put "ssm:/my/config/namespace"
       {:a 1
        :b "string"
        :c true
        :e ["a" "b" "c"]
        :d :keyword})

(e/get "ssm:/my/config/namespace")
;; returns the above map in put

(e/history "ssm:/my/config/namespace")

(e/delete "ssm:/my/config/namespace")
